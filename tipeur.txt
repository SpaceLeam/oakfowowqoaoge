Bot Authentication

How to get your bots authenticated?

DataDome is a cyber security solution that protects websites and APIs against bot traffic.

Any automated request coming from an unauthenticated bot is categorized as a "Bad Bot" and is blocked by default.

DataDome classifies and authenticates thousands of Commercial bots employed by hundreds of companies. Our customers can decide to authorize them based on their own bot policy.

If you would like to be part of the Commercial bot category, you will need to:

    Use a dedicated UserAgent
    Set up one of the authentication mechanisms detailed below
    And finally reach our support team

1. Reverse DNS

DataDome can authenticate Commercial bots by running a two-way RDNS/DNS lookup.
This is a strong and real time solution, which is used by major search engines like Google or Bing.
2. Static IP

In case your bot is using static IP addresses, you can share the list of all possible IP addresses with us.
3. Dynamic IP List

DataDome can authenticate Commercial bots by fetching their IP list.
We have a process in place to download and update the IP list (similar to Pingdom and Uptime).
You simply have to create and maintain a file (CSV, JSON, Plaintext) including all IPs used by your bots.
4. Private AS

DataDome can authenticate Commercial bots by checking a combination of AS numbers. In order to be secure, the AS must be a private corporater AS, not a common host AS (AWS, GCP, Hetzner).

Device Check
What is Device Check?

Device Check is a verification process that runs on the end user’s device, without the need for any user interaction. It can be loaded by web browsers and mobile applications, completely preserving end users’ privacy. Its purpose is to spot any type of automation frameworks, spoofed environments or programmatic access to the interfaces.

In simple terms, Device Check acts like a CAPTCHA, without prompting any challenge to the end user. The verification runs automatically:

    if the requester is a legitimate human user, the requested content is loaded
    if the request comes from a bot, it is blocked or additionally challenged

Why Device Check?

Device Check supports DataDome’s bot protection with several benefits:

    sophisticated and evasive bots can be detected from their first requests;
    limited friction on user experience, reducing the false positive rate and the usage of captcha;
    the protection level can be increased in sensitive contexts, proposing a more aggressive response;
    users’ privacy is completely preserved, as no personal information is collected during the verification.

How does Device Check work?

Device Check is used in two scenarios:

    When a bot is detected by DataDome, but the evidence of bot activity is not strong enough to block it or challenge it with a captcha
    When a request is suspicious and the requested resource or the request context presents potential risks

In both cases, a JS code is executed client-side, to collect hundreds of signals and perform several checkpoints on the device and environment. The result of the check is then sent back to DataDome, who sends back the final result, either blocking a malicious actor or redirecting to the requested resource. If additional information is still needed to make the final decision, DataDome can challenge the requester with a CAPTCHA.

Since no user interaction is required, behavioral models are not applied to analyze the signals collected by Device Check. Instead, client and device fingerprinting techniques are leveraged, together with specific automated challenges capable of detecting spoofed environments and devices.

Device Check is fully operational on web browsers, mobile browsers and mobile apps.
How often are end users verified with Device Check?

Device Check is only applied for suspicious requests, hence the majority of legitimate end users should never be verified by it. Nevertheless, there are contexts where the usage of a client-side check is particularly beneficial for protection, resulting in a wider usage on legitimate users. In any case, once a legitimate user is verified with Device Check, DataDome remembers the outcome and does not repeat the verification.
Visual customization

In the relatively rare occasions when a legitimate end user’s device is verified by DataDome’s Device Check, a simple page is displayed, informing about the ongoing verification.

The page is translated in 38 languages, and administrators can customize it per domain directly from DataDome Dashboard, under “Management” > “Response Pages”.

The available options for customization are:

    Upload a logo,
    Choice of the two colors to render the spinner element,
    The duration before redirection to the requested content (to let end users the time to read the short message indicating that a verification is being performed).
    An “invisible mode” is also available, in which case no visual content is displayed to the end user, and the redirection to the target resource is triggered as soon as the check completes.

Is Device Check compatible with any device?

If DataDome is correctly integrated, Device Check is compatible with all web browsers and mobile apps.

DataDome’s JS Tag must be correctly integrated in the web pages that originate XHR/fetch requests protected by DataDome.

Like DataDome CAPTCHA, Device Check is supported for the following browsers:

    Chrome ≥ 60
    Firefox ≥ 55
    Edge ≥ 80
    Opera ≥ 50
    Yandex ≥ 14
    Safari ≥ 9.1
    Internet Explorer 11 (Windows 10 only)

What data is collected by Device Check?

No personal information is collected by Device Check. Only technical details are inspected, including:

    Screen details:
        max resolution
        current resolution
        screen size
        video quality
        touch actions supported
    Environment information:
        audio and video codecs used
        supported media extensions
        active plugins
        checks on browser type and version
    Hardware information:
        CPUs
        GPUs
    Javascript challenges:
        JS functions whose results prove the consistency of the collected information
        Rendering of canvases
        Execution times

How to activate Device Check?

There is no need for activating Device Check: it is available by default for all customers and it is triggered based on the outcomes of DataDome’s detection models. It can also be forced by customers defining a custom rule or overriding a model's configuration.
Does Device Check work in China (Behind the China Firewall)?

Yes. It has been tested in several towns in China.

Key rotation

In today's digital landscape, protecting your integrations with third parties is paramount. As part of our ongoing efforts to uphold the highest standards of security, we emphasize the importance of key rotation for our keys. This documentation aims to provide comprehensive insights into the practice of key rotation within our product framework. By understanding and implementing key rotation effectively, you can bolster your security posture, mitigating potential risks and ensuring the integrity of your integration with DataDome. Let's delve into the intricacies of key rotation and see how to perform this rotation.
How to perform a key rotation?
Step 1 - Identify the Key to Sunset

Navigate to the Integrations tab within the Management section. Ensure you have the Admin role for access. Locate the key you wish to sunset along with its type from the listing. There are currently four different types of keys eligible for rotation:

    Server side key
    Management API Key - Full Access
    Management API Key - Read-only Access
    Account Protect Key

Step 2 - Generate a New Key of the Same Type

Once you've identified the key's type, proceed to create a new key of the same type. Click on the “Generate New Key” button positioned at the top right corner, then select the appropriate key type. A pop-up window will prompt you to name the key.

Note that the key name is immutable after creation, so choose wisely.

Confirm the action by clicking on “Generate Key,” and the new key will appear in the listing.
Step 3 - Activate Your New Key

By default, a newly generated key is in “Deactivated” status, rejecting any traffic or calls.

Switch its status to “Activated” by clicking on the extra actions button at the end of the new key line, then select “Activate.”

Confirm the activation in the pop-up window by clicking on “Activate key.”

The key status will change to “Activated,” ready to accept traffic or calls.
Step 4 - Replace the Key in Your System

Replace the key you wish to sunset with the newly created one in your system.

Ensure that your system behaves as expected after the replacement to maintain service continuity.
Step 5 - Verify the Sunset Key Is No Longer in Use

After replacing the key, ensure it is no longer in use. Utilize the “Last usage” column, which displays the date and time of the key's last usage.
Step 6 - Deactivate the Sunset Key

If the “Last usage” aligns with the replacement performed in Step 4, proceed with deactivating the key.

Click on the extra actions button at the end of the new key line, then select “Deactivate.”

Confirm the deactivation by clicking on “Deactivate key” in the pop-up window.

The key status will change to “Deactivated,” refusing all traffic or calls.

We recommend a 1-month observation period before deletion.
Step 7 - Delete the Sunset Key

Once you're certain it's safe to delete the key, return to the Integrations tab in the Management section.

Identify the key for deletion, click on the extra actions button at the end of the line, then select “Delete.”

Confirm the deletion by entering the key name and clicking on “Delete key” in the pop-up window.

Deleting a key is irreversible, so ensure your decision is final.

The key will no longer appear in the listing, signifying the completion of the key rotation process.

Congratulations on successfully rotating your key!
